# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
After being hired by PyBer, a Python based ride sharing app company, I was asked to perform an exploratory analysis on data in two csv files. With the help of Omar and Sasha, I created several types of visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data, that I will present to the CEO of PyBer, V. Isualize. While working on the presentation, I wrote Python scripts using Panda's libraries, the Jupyter notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. I hope the analysis and visualizations that are presented to V. Isualize will help PyBer improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
